I hope.","body":"# DapperContext\r\n\r\nDapperContext is a DbContext-like implementation for Dapper, supporting the Unit Of Work pattern and simplifying usage with repository classes and IOC containers.\r\n\r\n## How do I use this thing?\r\n\r\nWell, for now, this project is still in an alpha state, and I still have to build a NuGet package for it. When that happens, you can head over to NuGet inside Visual Studio and search for DapperContext, or add it to your project using the Package Manager Console window by typing:\r\n`Install-Package DapperContext -IncludePrerelease`\r\n\r\nNuGet will automatically fetch Dapper as well if you haven't already added this great lightweight ORM library to your project.\r\n\r\nMore information on usage will follow soon, so stay tuned :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
